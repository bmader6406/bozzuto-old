Slugify
=======

Slugify is a Rails plugin that automatically converts an attribute into a pretty URL slug and assigns it to another attribute. Conversion happens in a `before_validation` filter or by manually calling the `#slugify` or `#slugify!` instance methods.

Internally, it uses ActiveSupport's `#parameterize` method and is multi-byte safe.


Usage
-----

By default, slugify generates the slug from the `:title` attribute and assigns it to the `:slug` attribute:

    class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
      slugify
    end

    @page = Page.new :title => "Yay Hooray"
    @page.slugify
    @page.slug        # -> "yay-hooray"

Both fields can be overridden:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      slugify :name, :to => :permalink
    end

    @user = User.new :name => "Fox Mulder"
    @user.slugify
    @user.permalink   # -> "fox-mulder"

Slugify will only assign a slug if the `:to` attribute is blank. This is to prevent all the URLs from breaking every time the user changes a title. Continuing from the example above:

    @user.name = "Dana Scully"
    @user.slugify
    @user.permalink   # -> "fox-mulder"

To override, use the `#slugify!` instance method:

    @user.name = "Dana Scully"
    @user.slugify!
    @user.permalink   # -> "dana-scully"

or set the option in the DSL:

    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      slugify :title, :to => :permalink, :force => true
    end

Slugify will automatically validate for presence, format, and uniqueness. It's easy to scope the uniqueness constraint:

    class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
      slugify :title, :scope => :section_id
    end

or turn the constrain off:

    class BlogPost < ActiveRecord::Base
      slugify :title, :unique => false
    end

Include the ID
--------------

To include the id in the slug, do it in the `#to_param` method:

    class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
      slugify

      def to_param
        "#{id}-#{slug}"
      end
    end

_Bonus!_ If you include the id first, you can pass the whole slug into `#find` and it'll Just Workâ„¢:

    Book.create(:title => "The Stand")
    @book = Book.find("1-the-stand")
    @book.title     # -> "The Stand"

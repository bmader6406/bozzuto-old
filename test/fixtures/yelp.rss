			<title>Patricia S.&#39;s Review of Farmers &amp; Fishers - Washington, DC (3/5) on Yelp</title>
			<link>http://www.yelp.com/biz/farmers-and-fishers-washington#hrid:pBxAtp0dplZ9otexU_Kqkg</link>
			<description>It's really 2.5 stars, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.

We went here because of a recommendation from a friend, not knowing what to expect. First of all - I think the area is a bit tacky&amp;#8230;</description>

			<title>Marissa O.&#39;s Review of Columbia Pike Farmers Market - Arlington (3/5) on Yelp</title>

			<description>3.5.  It's not a huge market and is completely anemic in the winter.  (I actually went to check it out after one of the major snowstorms this year, and there were 4 poor vendors, braving the cold.&amp;#8230;</description>

			<title>Grant H.&#39;s Review of Chili&#39;s Grill &amp; Bar - Vienna (4/5) on Yelp</title>
			<link>http://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vienna#hrid:l7mbi4W82nYgO_FxMFo4_A</link>
			<description>The food here is always great, and the margaritas are tasty.
It is occasionally understaffed in the lounge area. When that happens, the service can be a little slow, which is especially frustrating&amp;#8230;</description>

			<title>Hannah C.&#39;s Review of National Gallery of Art - Washington, DC (5/5) on Yelp</title>
			<link>http://www.yelp.com/biz/national-gallery-of-art-washington#hrid:gMEuRGLl88h4dnMpf7Fh2w</link>
			<description>Best way to go to the museum: Alone.

Why: Because nothing that I like is what you will like and vice versa.  Also, this place is so big, I don't want to have to walk around looking at my favorite&amp;#8230;</description>

			<description>AMAZING selection of beer and wine at this place, and the prices are par for the neighborhood.  I haven't found a better beer selection anywhere in the city.</description>

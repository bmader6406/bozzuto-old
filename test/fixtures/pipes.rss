         <title>Kids/Family Day! Sunset Serenade- Walk, Talk, and Listen to the Music! 07/21</title> 
         <link>http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-030772391-5</link> 
         <description>Walk the Lake to Live Music-Family Night: Children Tunes! This weeks music features &quot;Uncle Pete and the Kids&quot; performing a kids concert at 7:00PM, which is during our walk. Bring a blanket, bring a picnic if you would like--although concessions will be available, and stick around and enjoy the live entertainment after our walk with the group! Look for great blue herons, white cattle egrets and little green herons stalking minnows among the reeds. Swallows, turkey vultures and hawks soar overhead, and kingfishers dive into the lake for fish. In summer, turtles sun themselves on logs and rocks. Cottontail rabbits nibble on grass at dawn and dusk. Red fox have been known to visit. A beaver family is building a lodge in the Wildlife Area that is blocked by a buoy line to provide safe spawning for fish and nesting sites for birds. In warm months, look for colorful monarch and swallowtail butterflies and dragonflies among the wildflowers. Trail Information Nearby City: Columbia, MD Length: 2.4 total miles Elev. Gain: 300 feet Trail Type: Loop Skill Level: Easy Duration: 45 Minutes = about one lap for the average walker Season: Year-round Trailhead Elev: 120 feet Top Elev: 420 feet Weather Information We walk rain or shine! Click here for up to the minute weather information for this walk. We walk counterclockwise (this is to the right if you are facing the lake), so if you are late you can start walking the other direction and hook up with us, or call me and we will let you know where we are. Step Off Time is 6:45 We all &quot;step off&quot; at the same time, but some walk faster, while others just stroll. Also, some people walk one lap, while others walk two. No matter what your speed or distance, there should be someone for you to walk with. Come on out and join us for fun and exercise! Directions to the Trailhead Click here for directions and information to where to meet us at the park. FIDO is welcome on this hike! The event is free but they ask for a 3.00 dollar donation when you park but is not obligatory! See you there!

This lazy comedy barely gets by with obvious jokes delivered by a high-recognition cast that includes a few stars for whom the movie amounts to a circa 1990s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;...</description>

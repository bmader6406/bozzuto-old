The app needs to be running at bozzuto.local in order for assets to load. The easiest way to do this is by using [POW](http://pow.cx/)

* Create a .powconfig in your home directory with the following:

	export POW_DOMAINS=local,dev
	
* Install:

	curl get.pow.cx | sh
	
* Setup the Bozzuto app:

	cd ~/.pow
	ln -s /path/to/bozzuto
	
* Create a config.ru in the root of the app with the following:

	require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/config/environment'
	run ActionController::Dispatcher.new
	
* Add bozzuto.local to your hosts file:

	127.0.0.1	bozzuto.local
	
* You may have to turn off web sharing in order for your site to load in a browser
